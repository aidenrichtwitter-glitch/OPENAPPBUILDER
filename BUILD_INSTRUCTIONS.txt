============================================================

PREREQUISITES:
  1. Python 3.11+ installed (python.org)
  2. Ollama installed and running (ollama.com)
  3. Your Qwen model pulled: ollama pull qwen2.5:32b-instruct-q5_K_M

  pip install customtkinter ollama openai pyautogui pyperclip numpy scipy bezier pillow pyinstaller

STEP 2 - Copy all project files to a folder on your PC:
  main.py
  views.py
  handlers.py
  ai_functions.py
  browser_automation.py
  config.py
  constants.py
  utils.py
  build.py
  (optional: icon.ico for a custom app icon)

STEP 3 - Run the build:
  cd YourFolder
  python build.py

STEP 4 - Find your exe:
  The built app will be in: dist/AppBuilder/AppBuilder.exe
  Double-click it to run!

NOTES:
  - The "projects" folder is created next to the .exe automatically
  - Generated apps are saved in that projects folder
  - Ollama must be running on your PC for AI features to work
  - The Grok API key is built into the app (config.py)

OPTIONAL - Custom Icon:
  Place an icon.ico file in the same folder as build.py
  before running the build. It will be used as the app icon.
